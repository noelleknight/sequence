1. Logging in:
   * The sequence app homepage allows users to login or create an account.

   * Sequences are filtered via Body Focus and Difficulty Level.
   * Users assign their sequence a name.
   * Once these parameters are specified and the sequence is submitted, the app generates the new sequence.

   * Once the sequence is created the user is able to view their new sequence.
   * The app saves user sequences for viewing whenever they are logged in.
